### üí° Core Features (Space Exploration & Data Presentation)

* **Animated Stars Background**: The website incorporates a captivating animated stars background that creates an immersive, celestial atmosphere, featuring radial gradients for a nebulous effect and twinkling stars that subtly animate across the screen.
* **Hero Section with Dynamic Counters**: The initial view presents a striking hero section with the title "Cosmosphere" and a descriptive subtitle. Animated counters increment to display key statistics like "Years of Exploration," "Satellites Launched," and "Humans on Moon."
* **Interactive Space Exploration Timeline**: This section provides a chronological overview of significant milestones in space exploration, categorized into "Early Era (1950s-1960s)," "Golden Age (1970s-1980s)," "Modern Era (1990s-2010s)," and "Future (2020s+)". Users can navigate between these eras, and each timeline item includes a year, title, description, and relevant statistics.
* **Data Visualisations**: Cosmosphere presents complex space exploration data through various interactive charts:
    * **Launch Success Rate (Progress Ring Chart)**: A circular progress chart visually represents the success rate of space missions.
    * **Countries in Space (Bar Chart)**: A bar chart illustrates the percentage contribution of different countries (USA, Russia, China, Others) to space exploration.
    * **Mission Types (Pie Chart)**: A pie chart breaks down space missions into categories such as Satellites, Planetary, Crewed, and Deep Space.
* **Interactive Space Mission Simulator**: Users can select a "Mission Type," adjust "Fuel Level" and "Crew Size," and the simulator dynamically calculates and displays "Success Probability," "Mission Cost," and "Duration". A "Launch Mission" button triggers an engaging rocket animation and presents a success or failure outcome.
* **The Future of Space Exploration**: This section highlights ambitious projects like "Mars Colonization," "Lunar Base," "Asteroid Mining," and "Interstellar Travel," each with a brief description and a progress bar. Clicking on these cards reveals more detailed information in a modal popup, including timelines and key challenges.
* **Tooltips for Enhanced Information**: Interactive tooltips appear on hover over certain elements, providing additional context.

### üé® User Interface & Experience

Cosmosphere provides a visually rich and responsive user interface:

* **Immersive Design**: The overall design is geared towards creating an immersive space-themed experience with celestial backgrounds and vibrant gradient accents.
* **Responsive Layout**: The application's layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear buttons and interactive elements guide the user through the timeline, data visualizations, and simulator.
* **Dynamic Animations**: Smooth transitions, counter animations, and visual feedback (like the rocket launch) enhance user engagement.
* **Clear Information Hierarchy**: Content is logically organized into distinct sections, making it easy for users to find information about different aspects of space exploration.
